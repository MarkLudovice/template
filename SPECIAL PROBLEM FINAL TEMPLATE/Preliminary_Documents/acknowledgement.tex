    \section{ACKNOWLEDGEMENT}
\end{centering}

This thesis would have not been possible without the guidance and the help of several individuals, who in one way or another, contributed and extended their valuable assistance in the preparation and completion of this study.

We are heartily thankful to our advisers, Ryan A. Rodriguez and Christian Y. Sy, for their unselfish and unfailing support.  We also would like to express our gratitude to Dr. Madeline Ra√±ola,  Head of Bicol Regional Blood Center, Christina Yanzon, Medical Specialist and Christopher Asonza, Head of IT Department of DOH-CHD Bicol for their cooperation and generosity in sharing  relevant data for our study. We sincerely appreciate the never-ending support and encouragement of our friends and classmates in the development of this study. We share the credit of our work with our family who never stopped believing on us. Without their support, encouragement and understanding this thesis would have remained a dream.

Last but not the least, the omnipresent God, for answering our prayers, for giving us the strength to pursue this study and for the continuous guidance, thank you so much Lord GOD.
