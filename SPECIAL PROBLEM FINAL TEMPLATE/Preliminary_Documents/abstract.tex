The developed system intends to make the transactions of Bicol Regional Blood Center (BRBC) more convenient, accurate and efficient.  The main functions of this system are blood inventory and monitoring, online application/donor recruitment, scheduling of mobile blood donation activity,  online order/request of blood products by the blood stations from the Bicol Regional Blood Center and report generation.  The study adopted the developmental method of research and used Systems Development Life Cycle.

Bicol Regional Blood Center tested the developed system and made a positive feedback on the functionality program in relation to their major transactions.  The representative from BRBC recognized the system as a user-friendly plan but made some recommendations on the security aspect.
The developed system complied with the requirements of Bicol Regional Blood Center.  It is recommended that the system should be implemented considering the benefits BRBC, its clients and licensed hospitals will get.
