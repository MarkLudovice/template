\noindent\textbf{Rubik's Cube}\\
\hspace*{1.5cm}Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ernő Rubik.  Originally called the "Magic Cube", the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Ideal Toy Corp.  It is widely considered to be the world's best-selling toy (Field, 2005). 

In a classic Rubik's Cube, each of the six faces is covered by nine stickers, each of one of six solid colours (traditionally white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow, where white is opposite yellow, blue is opposite green, and orange is opposite red, and the red, white and blue are arranged in that order in a clockwise arrangement).  An internal pivot mechanism enables each face to turn independently, thus mixing up the colours.  For the puzzle to be solved, each face must be returned to consisting of one colour.  Similar puzzles have now been produced with various numbers of sides, dimensions, and stickers, not all of them by Rubik.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is technology and a branch of computer science that studies and develops intelligent machines and software.  Major AI researchers and textbooks define the field as "the study and design of intelligent agents", where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success.  John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1955, defines it as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines".

The central problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, communication, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.  General intelligence (or "strong AI") is still among the field's long term goals.  Currently popular approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence and traditional symbolic AI.  There are an enormous number of tools used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, logic, methods based on probability and economics, and many others.

\subsection{Synthesis}
\vspace{-3ex}
The previous reviewed literature and studies from both foreign and local authors were collected to relate their significance with the work of the present researcher. Resources that have been gathered revealed issues and facts that made ideas clearer in the present study. 

It has been found out that the study of P. Anupriya and S. Karpagavalli that using an inventory management system to monitor and track stock for an organization, made transactions more efficient. Furthermore, the study of Ostrowski provided a real time and accurate actual count of stocks on hand. The proposed study will include all features stated in the related literature and studies and additionally will integrate a notification features that can automatically notify if any transactions have been made.
